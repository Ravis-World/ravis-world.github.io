        <p>
            Raviolo and the team have reached Dr. &Eta;'s base.<br>
            "So, this is your base, Heleena?" Raviolo asks.<br>
            Heleena now remembers what she needed to do in order to stop the virus.<br>
            "Yes, it is," Heleena replies.<br>
            "I have been working on a new project here. It's the cure for the virus that has been plaguing the world. I never got to finish it because of prior occurrences, and now I remember what I was doing."<br>
            "That's great news!" Raviolo exclaims. "How does it work?"<br>
            Heleena pulls out a video cassette tape and puts it into a VCR emulator.<br>
            "This is a video of the experiment I conducted to create the cure. It shows how the virus was created and how it can be cured."

                Hi, I'm Heleena Lengyel, and this is an overview of the Vorvathis Anomaly, and the cure.<br>
                This virus is a special goo that transforms its host into a zombie.<br>
                To make the cure, I used silver, a part of a pig's brain, and heavy water.<br>
                If we can distribute this virus to the entire world, we can save it.
            </p>
            <p class="continue">
                "This is amazing!" Raviolo says. "But how do we know it will work?"<br>
                "I have tested it on myself and it worked," Heleena replies. "I am now immune to the virus."<br>
                "That's great! But what about the rest of the world?"<br>
                "I have created a machine that can replicate the cure and distribute it to everyone."<br>
                "That's incredible! How does it work?"<br>
                "The machine uses a special formula that I created to replicate the cure. It can produce enough cure for the entire world in just a few days."<br>
                Heleena talked about this cure for a while, and then she said, "I have a plan to distribute the cure to the entire world. I will need your help to do it."<br>
                "Of course, I'm in!" Raviolo replies eagerly.<br>
                "Great, I've already started working on the machine. It will be ready in a few hours."<br>
                "That's amazing! I can't wait to see it in action."<br>
                "Me too," Heleena says with a smile. "Let's get to work."<br>
                "Here is a manual for the machine and how to make the virus," Heleena says, handing Raviolo a manual. "It will help you understand what is happening."<br>
                "Thank you, Heleena. I will read it carefully," Raviolo replies before questioning "Is it possible that we are currently in the real world, instead of Dora's world? The game still progresses in doors."<br>
                "I don't know, but I think we are in the real world," Heleena replies. "I have been working on this project for a long time, and I have never seen anything like it."<br>
                The rest of the team sigh in relief, as they are also out of the simulation and in the real world; all by Door's actions.<br>
                "I hope you're right," Raviolo says, feeling a sense of hope for the first time in a long time.<br>
                "I am," Heleena replies confidently. "We will save the world together."<br>
