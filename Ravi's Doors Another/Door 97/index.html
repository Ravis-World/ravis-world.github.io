        <h1>Door 97</h1>
        <p>
            After successfully defeating the doppelgängers, Raviolo and his team advanced into the next room, where a daunting three-way passage awaited them.<br>
            Each path was marked with a distinct symbol: a flame, a wave, and a mountain. The symbols seemed to represent different challenges, each with its own set of dangers and rewards.<br>
            Each path seemed equally treacherous, but only one would lead them closer to their goal. As the team deliberated over their choice, tension filled the air, with each member weighing the risks and possibilities based on the cryptic clues left behind by Dr. Γ.<br>
            The decision was critical, as the wrong choice could lead them into a trap or worse, jeopardising their mission to deliver the cure.<br>
            With the fate of their mission hanging in the balance, they had to choose wisely, knowing that each path could either lead them to success or doom them to failure.

                <strong>Failure:</strong> The team chose the wrong path again. They were led into a deadly trap, where they faced a series of lethal challenges that tested their resolve and skills. Despite their best efforts, they were unable to overcome the obstacles, resulting in their demise.

                <strong>Success:</strong>
                Entering the correct passage, they found themselves in a dimly lit chamber. At its centre stood a series of mechanical targets, each painted with vivid, concentric circles, and perched on platforms that rotated sporadically.<br>
                The room was equipped with a single weapon: a sniper rifle nicknamed the “XSHOT Excel Ranger X8 Blaster,” its polished surface gleaming ominously under the flickering lights. This challenge demanded precision and teamwork, as every member of the team had to hit a designated target to unlock the next door.<br>
                However, the task was far from straightforward. The targets moved unpredictably across the room, disappearing into hidden alcoves and reappearing in different configurations. Adding to the difficulty, a countdown timer started ticking as soon as Raviolo picked up the rifle, its rhythmic pulses amplifying the pressure.<br>
                The room was on a timer that would replace all oxygen with hydrogen if they failed to complete the challenge in time, creating an atmosphere of urgency and danger. The team had to work together, coordinating their shots and timing their actions perfectly to hit the targets before the countdown reached zero.<br>
                With roles swiftly assigned, the team collaborated to spot, aim, and fire at each elusive target, their cohesion and courage shining through in this perilous trial.
