            Door 79 – Soft Crunch<br>
            CR &alpha;
        </h1>
        <p>
            The team continued down the corridor, the portraits still looming over them. They could hear a soft crunching sound, like footsteps on gravel. It was a sound that sent shivers down their spines.<br>
            "What is that noise?" asked Grey Box, looking around nervously.<br>
            "I don't know," replied Door, her voice barely above a whisper. "But we need to be careful. We don't know what else is lurking in this place."<br>
            The team pressed on, their hearts racing as they navigated the twisted corridor. The crunching sound grew louder, echoing off the walls and filling the air with an eerie tension.<br>
            It turned out that this room had a floor covered with fragile eggs filled with the same alien goo that turned its hosts into zombies. The team had to be careful not to step on them, or they would risk getting their feet trapped in the goo.<br>
            "Ew, this stuff is nasty." said Stella, who had some goo on one sole of her sandal boots.<br>
            "I don't like this place," said Toadette, her voice trembling. "It's like a nightmare come to life."<br>
            "We need to keep moving," said Raviolo, trying to sound brave. "We can't let this place get to us. We have to stay focused and find a way out."<br>
            "Look, up in the corner of the ceiling," called Toadette who saw a television screen. "It looks like there's something on the screen!"<br>
            The team looked up and saw flickering text on the screen. It flickered the following words: "Vorvathis: Early Tests Failed."<br>
            Then the text changed to the same text in Japanese: "<span lang="ja">ヴォルヴァティス： 初期テストは失敗しました。</span>"<br>
            Then again to the same text in Avian, the language of the birds: "<span id="avian">ВоꞭруваꞭҙiꞭс: РаȽноȽ Тэсто НеLуŁспе.</span>"<br>
            <span class="grey-box">We need to stay alert and be ready for anything. This place is full of surprises.</span><br>
            <span class="objective">Objective</span>: Avoid stepping on the eggs and triggering the goo traps to reach the tick and escape the room.<br>
            <span class="objective">Controls</span>: Use the arrow keys or buttons on mobile-controls to move the character.<br>
