            Door 81 – Glitching Doorframe (nicknamed Press Your Luck)<br>

            The team was in a room with a doorframe that was glitching. The doorframe was flickering and changing colours, making it difficult to see what was on the other side.<br>
            "What is going on with this doorframe?" asked Stella, trying to figure out what was happening. "It's like it's glitching out or something."<br>
            "I don't know," replied Raviolo, looking at the doorframe. "But we need to be careful. We don't know what could be on the other side."<br>
            "Maybe it's a trap," suggested Toadette, looking worried. "We should be careful."<br>
            "I think we should just go through it," said Door, trying to be brave. "We can't let a little glitching doorframe stop us."<br>
            <span class="objective">Objective</span>: Navigate through the glitching doorframe without getting stuck.<br>
            <span class="objective">Controls</span>: Press the Start button to start the pattern. When you think it is on the 4th square in the pattern, press the LOCK button to lock the door in that place.<br>
