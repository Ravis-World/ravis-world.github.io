            <p class="story-description">
                After successfully defusing the bomb, Raviolo and his team uncovered the truth:<br> 
                Door had been hacked again, this time by her long-lost friend, Bruno Ryūnosuke Ó Ciardha, aka Dr. &Gamma;.<br>
                He stole dangerous goo from distant planet Vorvathis to trap Raviolo and his team in a deadly experiment.<br>
                The goo is able to mutate its host, turning them into a creature with the goal of spreading infection.
            </p>
            <p class="story-description">
                Furious, Door wants to team up with Raviolo to defeat Dr. &Gamma; before the infection spreads further.

            <h2>Now</h2>
            <p class="story-description">
                Raviolo flipped through the worn files, each one stamped with the emblem of the Vorvathis Research Division. <br>
                Inside were horrifying photos: people suspended mid-air, frozen in goo. Some faces were half-melted, others frozen in panic.<br>
                He paused on one photo — some sort of child’s toy, half-submerged in slime, eerily intact. It was a clue, or maybe a warning. <br>
                The infection was spreading faster than they thought. These weren't just records. They were trophies.

                <p>Door: What is it?</p>
                <p>Raviolo: I just realised that the goo is actually a virus. It's not just a trap; it's a weapon.</p>
                <p>Door: We need to find Dr. &Gamma; and stop him before he can use it.</p>
                <p>Raviolo: But how? We don't even know where he is.</p>
                <p>Door: I have a plan. We need to find the source of the goo and destroy it.</p>

                <p>Door: I have a contact who might be able to help us. His name is Dr. &Eta;. She's a friend of mine.</p>
                <p>Raviolo: Dr. &Eta;? I've heard of her. He's a genius.</p>
                <p>Door: Yes, but he's also a bit of a recluse. He doesn't like to be disturbed.</p>
                <p>Raviolo: Well, we don't have a choice. We need to find her and get his help.</p>
                <p>Door: I know where he is. He's in a lab on the outskirts of the city.</p>
                <p>Raviolo: Let's go.</p>
