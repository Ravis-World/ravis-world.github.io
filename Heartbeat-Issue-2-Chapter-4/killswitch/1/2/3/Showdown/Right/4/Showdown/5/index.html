            Can you hear me? It's Vernon Kay. I heard about that time when you couldn't talk with Raviolo in Sleep Mode anymore.<br>
            Good. You made it through the safe. Now there's one more thing that I have been keeping secret. I am now able to share it with you in Sleep Mode.<br>
            After the contestant opts out of the game, or completes all of the levels, like you did, they will need to play one final Cashout round. However, the trojan got to it first, so you didn't actually kill the trojan.<br>
            Do you know what this means? It means that we are too late. Get out of sleep mode, NOW!!!!, befrrfrrrfrffffffffffffffffffrf..r   . .f. f. /////  /
