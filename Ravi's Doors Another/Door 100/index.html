        <h1>Door 100</h1>
        <p>
            The team confronts Dr. Γ in a chamber pulsating with ominous energy, its walls lined with flickering screens displaying fragments of their past exploits and trials. Dr. Γ, shrouded in an aura of malevolence, stands at the helm of a monstrous machine — a intricate contraption of wires, gears, and glowing circuits. The machine, they realise, is the source of the chaos and suffering that has plagued countless lives.<br>
            Raviolo and his team, equipped with their collective wisdom and unwavering determination, formulate a daring plan to reverse the operation of the machine. Their goal is to transform its destructive capabilities into a force that distributes the cure to every corner of the afflicted world.<br>
            As the team works feverishly to dismantle the machine's nefarious programming, Dr. Γ attempts to thwart their efforts, unleashing defensive traps and riddles designed to exploit their weaknesses. Each challenge they overcome brings them closer to unravelling the mysteries of the machine and Dr. Γ's true motives.
