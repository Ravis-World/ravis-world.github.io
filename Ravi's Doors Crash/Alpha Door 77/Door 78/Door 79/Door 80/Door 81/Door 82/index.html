            Dashing through the door, the team found themselves in a room filled with muted messages. The walls were covered in strange symbols and the air was thick with an eerie silence.<br>
            "What is going on here?" asked Stella, looking around. "It's like we're in a room full of secrets."<br>
            "I don't know," replied Raviolo, trying to decipher the symbols. "But we need to be careful. We don't know what could be hidden in these messages."<br>
            "Maybe it's a trap," suggested Toadette, looking worried. "We should be careful."<br>
            Suddenly, Grey Box saw something moving in the corner of the room. "Look!" he shouted, pointing to a shadowy figure lurking in the darkness.<br>
            <img src="lady.jpeg" alt="A light shone on the figure, revealing a pretty lady dressed in a white dress with a yellow tutu; she wore a matching colour skirt and a white top, as well as pink shearling boots. Her hair was long and flowing, and she had a torment expression on her face." id="lady-image" aria-describedby="lady">

            "There you all are!" she exclaimed, her voice echoing in the silence. "I've been waiting for you! I need your help!"<br>
            "Who are you?" asked Stella, stepping forward. "What do you need help with?"<br>
            "They are all watching us," the lady said, her eyes wide with fear. "I can't stay here much longer. You have to help me escape!"<br>
            "Escape? From what?" asked Raviolo, confused.<br>
            "I was trapped here by an evil person named Dora Dharman," the lady explained. "She has been using these muted messages to control me and keep me from leaving. But I can't take it anymore! I need your help to break free!"<br>
            "We'll help you," said Toadette, stepping forward. "But we need to know more about this Dora Dharman and how to break the control she has over you."<br>
            "Toadette! You have the attention span of a goldfish" Door said. "That name, that's MY name! I am Dora Dharman!"<br>
            The anonymous lady gasped, her eyes wide with shock. "No! You can't be! You're not like her!"<br>
            "Well obviously", Raviolo said. "We all have a bigger problem to deal with. "Dora realised her mistake and is on our side now. We need to stop an apocalypse from happening!"<br>
            "An apocalypse?" the lady asked, her voice trembling. "What do you mean?"<br>
            "Dora Dharman's friend, Bruno Ó Ciardha, is trying to destroy the world," Raviolo explained. "We need to stop him before it's too late!"<br>
            "But how?" the lady asked, her voice shaking. "I don't know how to break free from her control!"<br>
            "Just follow my lead," Raviolo said, his voice steady. "We'll figure it out together. We just need to stay focused and work as a team!"<br>
            "Okay," the lady said, her voice trembling. "I'll do my best. But I don't know if I can trust you." She looked at Raviolo, her eyes filled with doubt.<br>
            "You can trust me," Raviolo said, his voice steady. "I promise I won't let you down. We'll get through this together... uh, what was your name again?"<br>
            "Heleena Lengyel is my name," the lady said, her voice steadying. "And I will do whatever it takes to help you stop this apocalypse!"<br>
            "Great!" Raviolo said, a smile spreading across his face. "Now let's get to work!"<br>
