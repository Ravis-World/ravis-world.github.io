            <h1>Down The Ladder</h1>
            <p>
                The birds successfully climb down the ladder into the sewers. <br>
                Water drips from the ceiling, echoing through the dim, mossy corridor. Pipes groan quietly as the group steps onto the damp floor, their feathers slightly ruffled by the descent.<br>
                Chuck peers around the corner. “Smells like mystery and bad plumbing,” he whispers.<br>
                Matilda: Keep your eyes open. Creeper Jack won’t make it easy to reclaim the citrine gemstone.<br>
                As they proceed cautiously, Bomb accidentally steps on a soft patch of floor. It hisses, then clicks.<br>
                Red raises his wing. “Wait… did anyone else hear that?”<br>
                A loud rumble answers him.<br>
                From the darkness, a wall panel rotates open to reveal a surveillance camera blinking red.<br>
                “I think we’re being watched,” Blue gulps.<br>
                Suddenly, two paths light up: one leads to a locked vault door with a keypad, and the other to a tunnel marked with old symbols.<br>
                What should the birds do next?
