        <h1>Aftermath</h1>
        <p>
            In an electrifying culmination of courage and intellect, Raviolo successfully integrates the cure into the machine's core, triggering a cascade of transformations across its intricate systems.<br>
            The machine roars to life one final time, not as an instrument of despair, but as a beacon of hope. Streams of light and energy burst forth, spreading the cure everywhere, marking the beginning of a new chapter for all those who suffered under Dr. Î“'s reign.<br>
            With their mission complete, the team stands victorious, though not without scars. Everyone was safe, and the team are back in the real world, with some hard-earned riches.<br>
            Emerging from the chamber, they are greeted by the dawn of a new day, the sky ablaze with hues of promise. Crowds gather outside, their faces lifting in awe as the news of the cure spreads like wildfire. For the first time in years, smiles replace shadows on the faces of the afflicted.<br>
            Raviolo turns to his team, a quiet determination in his eyes. "This is just the beginning. We rebuild from here, together," he says, his voice steady but filled with emotion.<br>
            The team nods in unison, their hearts swelling with purpose. They have faced the abyss and emerged not only victorious but united in their resolve. And so, they step forward into a world reborn, a beacon of hope against the darkness.
