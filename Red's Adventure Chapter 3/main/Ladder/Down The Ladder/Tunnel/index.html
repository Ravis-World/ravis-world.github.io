            <h1>Tunnel</h1>
            <p>
                The birds proceed down a narrow tunnel carved with ancient symbols. The markings run in a continuous line — but unlike modern scripts, they flow <strong>bottom to top</strong>.<br><br>

                Chuck pauses, his eyes scanning rapidly. “Wait... I recognise this! It’s <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogham' target='_blank'>Ogham</a> — old Irish script.”<br><br>

                Matilda raises a brow. “How do you even know that?”<br>
                Chuck: “I read fast. Like, <em>really</em> fast.”<br><br>

                The symbols appear below, carved into the tunnel wall:
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br> <!--Why all these line breaks? Because I don't want the Ogham to get in the way-->

            <div class="ogham-stack">
                <span>᚛ᚐᚔᚅᚋᚆᚔ᚜᚛ᚑᚚᚐᚏ᚜᚛ᚃᚓᚖᚂ᚜</span>
            </div>

            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
                After a moment, Chuck translates: <strong>“animal. job. meat.”</strong><br>
                <br>
                Red frowns. “That’s… unsettlingly vague.”<br>
                Bomb: “Maybe it’s a menu?”<br>
                Blue gulps. “Are we the meat?”<br>
                Up across the birds see a computer lock. They have to enter the passcode based on those three words. Maybe they point to something that is related.
