        <h2>Door 96</h2>
        <p>
            Raviolo and his team found themselves burdened with a mission of utmost importance—to distribute a life-saving
            cure to the world.<br>
            Just as they prepared to complete their task, they were suddenly yanked back into the mysterious and perilous
            realm of Door’s universe by none other than the enigmatic Dr. Γ. This formidable figure presented them with an
            ultimatum: the cure could only be delivered if they succeeded in navigating an intricate gauntlet of challenges
            and trials he had devised.<br>
            The team stood before their first decision—a pair of looming doors. One promised a path forward, while the other
            would lead them into a deadly trap.<br>
            The choice was theirs to make, but the stakes were higher than ever before. With the fate of countless lives
            hanging in the balance, they had to choose wisely.<br>

                <strong>Failure:</strong> The team chose the wrong door, leading them into a deadly trap. They were forced
                to confront a series of lethal challenges, ultimately resulting in their demise.

                <strong>Success:</strong> The team chose the correct door, allowing them to proceed safely through the
                gauntlet. Beyond the door lay a chilling ordeal that would evaluate their very identities: they were to
                confront and defeat doppelgänger versions of themselves, twisted reflections that embodied their darkest
                fears and flaws.<br>
                Each member of the team faced their own doppelgänger, a sinister version that mirrored their worst traits
                and insecurities.
