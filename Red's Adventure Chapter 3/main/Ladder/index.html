        <h1>Ladder</h1>
        <p>
            Red squints at the rust-covered ladder. “Think this thing still works?”<br>
            Matilda inspects the bolts. “Mostly... but we'll have to climb quietly. One wrong step and it might collapse.”<br>
            One by one, the birds descend carefully. Bomb holds his breath the entire time.<br>
            “I'm not sure I like this,” he whispers, watching the ladder sway slightly with each movement.<br>
            “Just keep your balance,” Matilda reassures him. “We'll be fine.”
