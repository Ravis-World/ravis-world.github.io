            Door 77 – Slippery Silence<br>

        <p>
            Just as Raviolo and the team were about to leave the room, a loud crash echoed through the corridor. The door swung open, revealing a figure cloaked in shadows. He ran away and activated the alarm. The team had to act fast. They quickly gathered their equipment and rushed out of the room, following the sound of footsteps echoing down the hallway.<br>
            As they sprinted through the dimly lit corridors, they could hear the sound of the alarm blaring in the distance. The figure was fast, but Raviolo and his team were determined to catch him- wait, where'd they go?<br>
            Ah, it was just a trap. The team are stuck in a room that, according to the sign on the door (title) is called "Slippery Silence".<br>
            The room is a corridor coated in dried goo — no enemies, no movement, just faint echoing breathing from nowhere. One wrong step sends a character sliding backward to the start.<br>
            <span class="objective">Objective</span>: Maintain complete silence to avoid triggering motion sensors made from crystallised slime.<br>
            <span class="objective">Controls</span>: Use the arrow keys or tap to move the character.
