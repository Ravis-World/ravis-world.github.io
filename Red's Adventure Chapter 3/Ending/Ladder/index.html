        <h1>Chapter Complete</h1>

        <p>
            Creeper Jack was no match for your bravery. With one final surge, the birds overwhelmed him, sending him back in to the shadows of his dimension. All that was left to do is to reclaim the stolen <strong>citrine gemstone</strong> and save the planet of Mǒchá from total power collapse.<br>
            Bomb remembers the secret word: DOVWWLY, and then everything clicks into place.<br>
            He goes to the lock override switch and starts to write on paper; he deciphers the word, and what do you know, Creeper Jack is the rightful owner of Burger King™, in the Creeper Dimension. The word was hinting at it all along. The word is WHOPPER.<br><br>
            “I can't believe we made it,” says Red, brushing off dust.<br>
            “That ladder could’ve killed us,” Bomb mutters.<br>
            Matilda smirks. “But it didn’t. That’s what counts.”<br>
            The locals begin to re-emerge from hiding. One bows deeply, whispering:<br>
            “Thank you. Mǒchá is safe once more.” A new symbol appears on the birds' intergalactic map—proof of their triumph.<br>
            With the gemstone recovered, three portals down, and many worlds still to explore, the flock turns toward their next destination.<br>
            Whatever lies ahead, one thing is clear—<em>this was only the beginning</em>.
