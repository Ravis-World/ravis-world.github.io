            Door 80 – Reverse Controls<br>

        <p>
            The team returned to the same room with eggs being replaced with mines. Security mines that would explode if they stepped on them. The team had to be careful not to step on them, or they would risk getting blown up.<br>
            Stella's sandal boots suddenly started getting heavier and heavier. She looked down and saw that her sandals were covered in a thick layer of goo.<br>
            Stella immediately started to panic. "Oh no! I'm gonna turn into a zombie!" she screamed, trying to shake the goo off her sandals.<br>
            Diamond, the first aid person, quickly pulled out a skip card from Raviolo's prototype card game "Constant: Math Shedding-type Game"; this removed the goo and caused Stella to not turn into a zombie. How in the world such power exists, we'll never know.<br>
            "Wait, wasn't that game published already?" asked Toadette, confused. She then processed in her mind "I must be thinking of another game."<br>
            "No, it was just a prototype," replied Raviolo. "But I guess it works in this world too."<br>
            As soon as Raviolo started to walk forward, he moonwalked backward instead. "What the photograph? Why am I walking backward?" he exclaimed, confused.<br>
            "I think the controls are reversed," said Door, trying to figure out what was going on. "We need to be careful not to step on any mines while we figure this out."<br>
            "This is so frustrating!" said Stella, trying to keep her balance as she walked backward. "I can't believe this is happening!"<br>
            "We need to stay focused," said Toadette, trying to keep her spirits up. "We can do this if we work together."<br>
            <span class="objective">Objective</span>: Navigate a maze using reversed logic — failure boots the team back to the start.<br>
            <span class="objective">Controls</span>: Use the arrow keys to move. The up arrow key moves you down, the down arrow key moves you up, the left arrow key moves you right, and the right arrow key moves you left.<br>
