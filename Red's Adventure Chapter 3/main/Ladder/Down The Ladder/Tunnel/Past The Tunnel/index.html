            As the door unlocks with a hiss, the birds step into a massive chamber lined with flickering monitors. Thick cables snake across the floor, converging at a single figure standing in the centre of the room.
            <br><br>
            It’s <strong>Creeper Jack</strong>.
            <br><br>
            He turns slowly, eyes glowing with a strange green light.
            </p>

            <p>
            Creeper Jack: “You’ve done well... too well. But this is where your adventure ends.”
            <br>
            Bomb growls. “We’ll see about that.”
            <br>
            Matilda: “Everyone ready? He’s not holding back.”
            </p>

            <p>
            The room dims. A siren blares overhead. A huge pulse from the gemstone lights up the walls with eerie green.
