            After escaping the security room, the team found themselves in another corridor. The corridor was filled with portraits of the team… but they're wrong —
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Door is missing</li>
            <li>Raviolo has a corrupted face</li>
            <li>Grey Box is painted crying</li>
            <li>Diamond is an actual diamond</li>
            <li>Stella never met Raviolo and lived a normal life in her house</li>
            <li>Toadette is recreated in Plotagon</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The team was confused. They had just escaped the security room, but now they were faced with a new challenge. The portraits on the walls seemed to mock them, each one a twisted version of their own faces. It was as if someone had taken their memories and distorted them into something grotesque.<br>
            "What is this place?" asked Raviolo, looking at the portraits with a mix of fear and anger. "Why are our faces all wrong?"<br>
            "I don't know," replied Door, her voice shaky. "But we need to find a way out of here. This place is messing with our heads."<br>
            The team pressed on, their hearts racing as they navigated the twisted corridor. They could feel the weight of the portraits bearing down on them, each one a reminder of their own fears and insecurities. It was as if the very walls were alive, whispering secrets and lies that threatened to tear them apart.<br>
            <span class="grey-box">We need to stick together, we can't let this place get to us. We have to stay focused and find a way out.</span><br>
