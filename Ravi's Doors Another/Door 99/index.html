        <h1>Door 99</h1>
        <p>
            Raviolo and his team now pass another corridor lined with five foreboding doors; each marked with peculiar symbols that seem to pulse faintly under the dim light.<br>
            The air is thick with suspense as they carefully study the intricate carvings etched onto each door, attempting to deduce their significance. Every step forward feels heavier, burdened by the knowledge that a single misstep could lead to unimaginable consequences.

                <strong>Success:</strong>
                After navigating the puzzling sequence of doors, the team emerges into a vast, dimly lit chamber. At the centre of the room stands an enigmatic toll mechanism—a contraption of gears, levers, and glowing panels. A deep, resonant voice fills the chamber with a cryptic demand: "To pass, you must render payment of
                <dfn>
                    <abbr title="10 crore rupees.">
                        ₹10,00,00,000
                    </abbr>
                </dfn>."<br>
                The group exchanges wary glances, their hearts racing as they try to interpret the meaning. What is the conversion of rupees to the Japanese Yen that they held onto?<br>
                Working together, they begin to examine the mechanism for clues, noticing that the glowing panels bear inscriptions that seem to correspond to elements of their past trials. Could this toll be a symbolic gesture, a reflection of their collective journey and the challenges they have overcome? The team delves into an intense discussion, weighing their options and piecing together their observations.
