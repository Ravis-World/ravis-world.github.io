            Heleena 95: Collect The Bottle<br>
            CR 0
        </h1>
        <p>
            Raviolo has succeeded in synthesising the final component of the cure.<br>
            "It's done!" he exclaims, holding up a small vial filled with a shimmering liquid.<br>
            "This is the cure for the virus" Heleena said. "We need to get it to the lab for testing and distribution."<br>
            Raviolo carefully places the vial in a protective case and hands it to Heleena. "Say, did you ever mention about the 7 vials on your desk?" he asks.<br>
            Heleena looks puzzled for a moment, then remembers. "Oh yeah, those are new elements I discovered while working on the cure. Maybe we can name them after us, since we're 7 and correspond to the 7 elements in the new periodic table."<br>
            Raviolo smiles. "I like that idea. Let's call them the 'Raviolo-Heleena Elements'- Wait, that's a terrible name. How about we just name them after ourselves?"<br>
            Heleena chuckles. "Sure, why not? We can let the player of this game view the paperwork after the game is completed."<br>
            Raviolo smiles and nods. "Sounds good to me. Also, nice fourth wall break there, Heleena. Now let's get this cure to the lab and save the world! Oh, wait. About the ending of the chapter, it's right here."
        </p>
        <p>This is the end of the chapter. Check back in a while for the grand finale.</p>
