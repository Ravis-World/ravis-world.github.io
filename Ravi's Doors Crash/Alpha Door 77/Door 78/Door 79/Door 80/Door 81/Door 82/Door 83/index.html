            "So, what are your occupations?" said Raviolo.<br>
            Heleena replied, "Before Dora came for me, I was a black hat hacker, part of Bruno's crew. I was the one who hacked the bank and stole the money. But when I realised what I have done, I decided to leave that life behind. I wanted to be a good person, so I stopped working for Bruno and soon enough Dora was furious with me. She wanted me to work for her, but I refused. So she sent her goons after me. I had to run away and hide but soon enough I was caught. I was taken to this secret location where I was tortured for life. Please, I don't want to stay here anymore. I want to go home."<br>
            Raviolo thought for a moment.<br>
            "So, according to my previous information, this can only lead to one conclusion. You are the person nicknamed Dr. &Eta;. We were actually looking for you. We need your help to stop whatever is suddenly behind our backs. You are the only one who can help us."<br>
            Heleena looked at him with a confused expression.<br>
            "What thing behind your back- Holy Guacamole! What is that thing?" she exclaimed, pointing at the giant slime monster that was now behind Raviolo.<br>
            The team needed to act fast. They had to get out of the room before the monster could attack them. Raviolo quickly grabbed Heleena's hand and pulled her towards the door.<br>
            "Come on! We have to get out of here!" he shouted.<br>
