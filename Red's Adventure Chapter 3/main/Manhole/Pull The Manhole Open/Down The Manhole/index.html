        <h1>Down The Manhole</h1>
        <p>The birds successfully pull the manhole open and fall down into a pit with the machine on one side and a door on the other side. Peeking through the door hole reveals a creeper on the other side talking on the phone to his presumed-to-be boss.</p>
        <ul class="conversation">
            <li class="other-message">Creeper King: And have you got the target in sight?</li>
            <li class="user-message">Creeper Jack: Not yet, but I sense them a few doors away; their exact location is an enigma.</li>
            <li class="other-message">That's great to hear. What stuff have you been up to?</li>
            <li class="user-message">Well, I've hijacked the entire planet's only source of energy, so that's a plus.</li>
            <li class="user-message">
                I also found a piece of paper that says:<br>
                The Worlds Of The Rainbow<br>

                Did an overseer write this poem? He has another poem called Writers Block:<br>

        <p>
            Blue: *gasp* He spoke our secret language!!<br>
            Creeper Jack: *up close on the other side of the birds* Hey, what are you doing!!!<br>
            Red: Perfect! Out of all the tones you could've used, you chose THAT‽‽‽<br>
            Blue: Red, why so many interrobangs?<br>
            The birds are now in an all out attack against the Creeper Jack. Help the birds defeat him and restore former glory to the planet.
